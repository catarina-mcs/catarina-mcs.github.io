                        Growing up, deciding on a career path was a big
                        challenge. There were so many possibilities and my
                        interests were so diverse, it was hard to pick a single
                        subject and commit to it. In the end, I decided on
                        marketing and went on to pursue both a Bachelor’s and a
                        Master’s degree. I was lucky enough to find work in the
                        industry, work which allowed me to explore and learn
                        about all the different sides of marketing. Slowly, I
                        began to realize that, as much as I loved studying the
                        topic, I didn’t find the actual work as fulfilling and
                        exciting. Around that time, I was tasked with helping to
                        restructure and redesign the website of the company I
                        worked for and during that process, I kept thinking
                        “there has to be a better way to do this than just
                        following our gut”. And that is how I discovered UX/UI
                        design and how my life started to change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few months later, when our world was turned upside
                        down due to a pandemic and my professional situation
                        shifted, I decided to take the bad with the good and
                        give UX/UI design a real try. I found the Interaction
                        Design Foundation, did several of their courses and
                        worked on a few personal projects. I got really excited
                        about this new path and so, when my big brother
                        suggested “if you’re learning how to design websites,
                        why don’t you learn how to code them as well?”, I
                        finally followed his advice. I never, in a million
                        years, thought that I would find web development
                        interesting or even be remotely good at it. I entered
                        this world with no expectations and maybe that is what
                        made falling in love with it even more exciting. All of
                        a sudden, I found myself completely immersed in courses
                        and tutorials, wanting to learn a million different
                        things and coding nonstop for hours. I loved the
                        creativity and problem-solving involved in writing the
                        code. How objective failure and sucess are - either the
                        code does what you intended it to or it doesn’t. The
                        magic of seeing beautiful designs come to life as you
                        type line after line. The wonderful feeling of finding
                        that one typo that drove you crazy for hours. I loved it
                        all. For the first time, I finally felt like I had found
                        my thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, after a long and inspiring learning period, I’m
                        ready to continue the journey while being a part of
                        something bigger. I can’t wait to see where this road
                        will take me, but I’ll make sure to continue enjoying
                        every step of it.
